## Project Scope:

Introduction: The guest house website project aims to provide an online platform for potential guests to explore accommodations, amenities, and book rooms at our guest house.
Platforms: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.

### Features:

● Room booking functionality
● Photo gallery showcasing rooms and facilities
● Contact form for inquiries and reservations
● Moving/scrolling Images of nearby tourist places

● Booking button which redirects to owner Whatsapp
● Responsive Design: Media queries were used to adjust layout and styling based on screen size, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

#### Technical Details:

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, and Bootstrap were utilized for front-end development.
Frameworks/Libraries: Bootstrap was employed for its responsive design components and utility classes.
Swiper.js is used for sliding images.

##### Maintaining and Updating Instructions:

● Content Updates: To update website content such as room descriptions, rates, and gallery images, access the respective HTML files in the
codebase. Make changes directly in the HTML markup and ensure proper formatting and styling.

● Software Updates: Regularly check for updates to the technologies and libraries used in the project, such as Bootstrap, Swiper.js, remixicon and
JavaScript librarys. Apply updates as needed to ensure compatibility and security.

● Bug Fixes: Monitor user feedback and website analytics for any reported issues or bugs. Address them promptly by identifying the root cause and
implementing necessary fixes in the codebase.

● Security Patches: Stay vigilant against security threats by applying security patches and updates to the website's software stack. Regularly
review and enhance security measures to protect user data and maintain trust.

● Backup Strategy: Implement a regular backup strategy to safeguard against data loss or website downtime. Backup both the codebase and database
regularly, and store backups securely offsite.

● Documentation Updates: Keep the documentation updated with any changes or enhancements made to the website. Document new features, design
decisions, and technical details to maintain a comprehensive reference for future maintenance and development efforts.

###### File Structure:

● index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point to the web application.

● sass/: Directory containing CSS files used to style the web pages.
main.css: The main CSS linked with the project.
main.scss: The main Sass code file.

● scripts/: Directory containing JavaScript files used for client-side scripting.
main.js: The main JavaScript file for the project.

● assets/d/: Directory containing image files used in this project.

###### Challenges Faced During Redesign Process:

● Ensuring our website maintains its functionality and aesthetics across different devices, especially mobile ones, posed some initial challenges.
However, I addressed these challenges through a series of iterative design adjustments. By strategically prioritizing content hierarchy and implementing responsive design techniques, I was able to seamlessly adapt the layout to accommodate varying screen sizes.
